Here one of the important difference between == and ===

==

only values are checked , their types are not checked

===

here value and type are also checked


example

var x = 20

if(x == 20) {
    console.log("same")
}

here output will be same

but if we change things little bit

var x = "20"

if (x === 20) {
    console.log("Same and Type also same")
} else {
    console.log("Types are not same")
}

This is the major difference between == and ===
