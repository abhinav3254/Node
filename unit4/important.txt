Here one of the important difference between == and ===

==

only values are checked , their types are not checked

===

here value and type are also checked


example

var x = 20

if(x == 20) {
    console.log("same")
}

here output will be same

but if we change things little bit

var x = 20;

if (x == 20) {
    console.log("Values are same but type isn't it")
}

if (x === 20) {
    console.log("Value and type are same")
}

This is the major difference between == and ===
